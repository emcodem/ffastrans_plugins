<b>HTTP Communicate Advanced Processor</b><br/>
This Processor executes the requested GET, POST etc.. http call<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Request Body input is invalid for GET call as in HTTP GET there is just no request body possible.
<br/>
<b>About Parameters</b>
<br/>
Parameters are valid for the "URL" and for the "Request Body" inputs. <br/>
You can use ffastrans variables directly in the url and request body but usually you want parameters to be escaped, be it url escaped, json escaped or xml escaped. <br/>
This is where the parameters function comes in handy. Instead of providing a ffastrans variable in the request body, you just write your own variable name. 
<br/>
<br/>
Example: we want to use %s_source% in a JSON request body. 
Your request body could look like:
<pre>
{
   "inputFile":"%s_source%"
}
</pre>
But this would lead to an invalid JSON being posted because s_source contains backslashes and these need JSON escaping. 
<br/>
Instead, you write your request body like:
<pre>
{
   "inputFile":"MYSOURCE"
}
</pre>
And in the parameter section, you define a parameter of type json named MYSOURCE with value %s_source%. <br/>
This will automatically JSON escape "s_source" so you do not need to JSON escape s_source using a populate variables processor before http communicate.

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Advanced Options</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Retry</b><br/>
Note that this is used for the case where your server is temporalily unavailable, e.g. it just reboots.
<br/><br/>
You can specify the http codes that you expect for a successful call. The request will be retried until either one of the specified http codes is returned by the server or until the maximum retry count is reached.
<br/>
Between each retry, we will wait "Retry delay" seconds until we try again. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Polling</b><br/>
Use this when you want to wait until a specific value is returned in the response. E.g. You wait for a 3rdParty transcoder to finish.
<br/>
The Processor will call the specified http call until the "Stop condition" is returned in the response OR the globally set timeout for processors is reached.
