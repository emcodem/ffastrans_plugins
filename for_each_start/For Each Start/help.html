This processor node will create one Branch for each item in a List (JSON Array) of items.<br/>
In other words, anything connected to the right of this processor will be executed as often as you have items in your input list.
<br/><br/>
<b>Foreach List</b><br/>
A JSON array of Items. Most simple example: ["0","1"]<br/>
In Production, the List of items might be generated by another processor, e.g. the Files Find Processor. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Target Value Variable</b><br/><br/>
This variable will contain the current Value from the list. Most likely you want to use %s_source% here if your foreach list consists of files.<br/><br/>
<b>Target Count Variable:</b><br/><br/>
This variable will contain the current Index of the current list item. Rarely used.</br></br>
<b>Hide main branch:</b><br/><br/>
The Branch that is incoming to this Foreach Processor actually ends here. You can decide if you want to see it in the job monitor or not.

<br/><br/><b> Important Notes: </b>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to how this processor works, a Hold-Synchronize Node later in the workflow cannot work correctly as it is not able to calculate the number of created branches anymore.
    <br/>
    Also, you can only connect one processor on Input and one processor on output of this Node. 
    <br/> This way, the foreach processor is enabled to give you error messages in case your workflow does something that is not supported by foreach. 
<br/><br/>
In This picture, we see multiple connections on input and output of the Foreach Node, this will not work and your job will throw a corresponding error message:<br/>

<br/>
This picture shows how we use "Populate Nodes" to workaround the issue. Note that those Populate nodes do not even need to be configured, they just need to be there. <br/>
