<h1>Remote Cmd executor</h1>
Make sure that ffastrans_remote_node is running on the target OS (run as daemon/service/autostart app). <br/>
<br/>
<h2>ffastrans_remote_node</h2>
A script/program located in the plugin processor folder. You must install/run this program on a target machine before you can remote execute jobs.

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Target Hostnames: </b><br/>
List of Hostnames that you want to execute the task on (ffastrans_remote_node must be running)

<br/><br/>
<b>Queue Name / Concurrency:</b><br/>
By default, we ignore any ffastrans internal Queue. Instead this processor has it's own queue system. <br/>
Queue Name allows you to re-use a single processing queue over multiple ffastrans workflows.<br/>
Each host of target hostnames can execute "Concurrency" tasks of the given queue name concurrently.<br/>
Example:<br/>
If you set queue Name to TESTING, concurrency to 2 and you have 2 hosts:<br>
*) Every host can execute 2 tasks for the queue name TESTING, so overall you can execute 4 parallel tasks in the TESTING queue, no matter in how many workflows you use this queue name. <br/>
*) If there are 4 Tasks running, each 2 on every host and 1 tasks finishes on one host, the oldest waiting job of all ffastrans workflows will start processing on the host that now has 1 free slot in TESTING queue.

<br/><br/>
<b>Command:</b><br/>
A cmd/shell command that will be executed unmodified on the target host. 
Note that if you execute on linux, you might first need to translate given file paths to the linux perspective.

<br/><br/>
<b>Save Output in Variable (stdout/stderr):</b><br/>
Defines a ffastrans user variable where the commandline output of the executed shell process is saved
