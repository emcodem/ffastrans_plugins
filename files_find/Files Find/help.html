<b>Files Find Processor</b><br/>
This Processor finds files and folders and outputs a simple JSON array with the found items.<br/><br/>
<b>Note</b> that you have to configure the "Path" where to start finding files! <br/>
Use %s_original_path% to search files in the same directory as the current source file of this job resides.
<br/><br/>
<b/>Usage examples :</b><br/>
Populate Variables Processor: use $readarray('%s_file_list%', 2)<br/>
Delete Files Processor: Provide a user_variable in the "File Variable" output and use the same variable in the input of the Delete Files Processor.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Path</b><br/>
Base path, this will not be included in output list <br/>
<br/>
<b>Include and Exclude patterns</b><br/>
Use like searching files in Windows Explorer, you can provide a comma separated list, e.g. *.m2v,*.wav <br/><br/>
<b>Older Than</b><br/>
Filter Files and Folders by age <br/>
<br/>
<b>Recurse:</b><br/>
Recurse into subdirectories <br/>
<br/>
<b>Skip Folders/Files</b><br/>
Do not include Folders/Files in output list<br/>
<br/>
<b>Only new Files</b><br/>
If enabled, the processor will remember which files have been already processed in a json file in Processors/db/cache/Files Find/watch_%proc_guid%<br/>
Processed Filenames will be "forgotten" if they are missing for one run in the watchfolder.
<br/>
<b>File Variable</b><br/>
If you provide a user_variable here, like %s_file_list%, it will be populated with the JSON array of found files<br/>
<br/>
<b>Count Variable</b><br/>
If you provide a user_variable here, you get the count of found items<br/>
<br/>
<b>Single File Outputs</b><br/>
If you provide a user_variable, it will be populated with the X'th item of the found list. You don't need to use $readarray function in follow-up processors. <br/>
